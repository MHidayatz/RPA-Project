# Web Scraping with UiPath

This repository contains the UiPath project files for web scraping product information from JD Sports. The project demonstrates how to automate the extraction of data such as product names, prices, and descriptions using UiPath's web scraping features.

## Overview

This project uses UiPath, a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool, to scrape data from JD Sports' website. The automation navigates through the website, extracts necessary information, and saves it in a structured format. This can be useful for price monitoring, market analysis, or gathering product data without manual intervention.

### Video Demonstration

A complete video walkthrough of the project setup and execution is available on YouTube. You can view it [here](https://youtu.be/bi8NITSu_QA).
